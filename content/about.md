My journey through life has been both unique and without limits and my art is a direct extension of that pattern with beauty and symmetry living on every scale, small to large. I have never taken the path laid out in front of me nor followed that of those who came before me. It has always been the unbroken glass of darkness and the unknown through which Iâ€™ve led myself down.

For better or for worse, it is my strength to proceed that has shown, time and time again, that there are no limits to what lies ahead. I create my art with this in mind and my focus each time is to break the ceiling that was once my highest reach. My art is a gateway into my life with each new piece depicting ideas that I have yet to pave a road towards.
